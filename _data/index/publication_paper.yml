- name: Probing Representation Forgetting in Continual Learning
  descr: Continual Learning methods typically focus on tackling the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting in the context of neural networks. Catastrophic forgetting is associated with an abrupt loss of knowledge previously learned by a model. In supervised learning problems this forgetting is typically measured or observed by evaluating decrease in task performance. However, a modelâ€™s representations can change without losing knowledge. In this work we consider the concept of representation forgetting, which relies on using the difference in performance of an optimal linear classifier before and after a new task is introduced. Using this tool we revisit a number of standard continual learning benchmarks and observe that through this lens, model representations trained without any special control for forgetting often experience minimal representation forgetting. Furthermore we find that many approaches to continual learning that aim to resolve the catastrophic forgetting problem do not improve the representation forgetting upon the usefulness of the representation.

- name: Semantic Similarity Matching Using Contextualized Representations
  descr: Different approaches to address semantic similarity matching generally fall into one of the two categories of interaction-based and representation-based models. While each approach offers its own benefits and can be used in certain scenarios, using a transformer-based model with a completely interaction-based approach may not be practical in many real-life use cases. In this work, we compare the performance and inference time of interaction-based and representation-based models using contextualized representations. We also propose a novel approach which is based on the late interaction of textual representations, thus benefiting from the advantages of both model types.

- name: TIMBERT&#58 Toponym Identifier For The Medical Domain Based on BERT
  descr: In this paper, we propose an approach to automate the process of place name detection in the medical domain to enable epidemiologists to better study and model the spread of viruses. We created a family of Toponym Identification Models based on BERT (TIMBERT), in order to learn in an end-to-end fashion the mapping from an input sentence to the associated sentence labeled with toponyms. When evaluated with the SemEval 2019 task 12 test set (Weissenbacher et al., 2019), our best TIMBERT model achieves an F1 score of 90.85%, a significant improvement compared to the state-of-the-art of 89.10% (Wang et al., 2019).

- name: Toponym Identification in Epidemiology Articles - A Deep Learning Approach
  descr: When analyzing the spread of viruses, epidemiologists often need to identify the location of  infected hosts. This information can be found in public databases, such as GenBank, however, information provided in these databases are usually limited to the country or state level. More fine-grained localization information requires phylogeographers to manually read relevant scientific articles. In this work we propose an approach to automate the process of place name identification from medical (epidemiology) articles. The focus of this paper is to propose a deep learning based model for toponym detection and experiment with the use of external linguistic features and domain specific information. The model was evaluated using a collection of 105 epidemiology articles from PubMed Central provided by the recent SemEval task 12. Our best detection model achieves an F1 score of 80.13%, a significant improvement compared to the state of the art of 69.84%. These results underline the importance of  domain specific embedding as well as specific linguistic features in toponym detection in medical journals.
