- question: "How can I get an update when a new post comes out?"
  answer: 'I post about my new post on this Twitter
  <a href="https://twitter.com/davari_reza" target="_blank">@davari_reza</a> account.
  There is also a <a href="!FEED_URL!" target="_blank">RSS feed</a>.</p>'

- question: "What tool do you use for plotting?"
  answer: 'I''m using Google Presentation (cloud version of PowerPoint) and
  <a href="http://draw.io/" target="_blank">draw.io</a>.'

- question: "Can I translate your posts to another language?"
  answer: 'Yes that would be my pleasure &#129303. But please <a href="!ABOUT_URL!" target="_blank">email</a>
  me in advance and please keep the original post link on top
  (rather than in tiny font at the end, and yes I do see that case and that makes me feel sad).'

- question: "I have papers on super relevant topics but you didn't include them?"
  answer: 'As you may know, it is pretty challenging to do a comprehensive literature review given a big topic.
  There are so so many papers in the wild. With Google scholar and recursive citation search, I get to see
  quite a lot of papers but still not all of them. You are more than welcome to shoot me an
  <a href="!ABOUT_URL!" target="_blank">email</a> with pointers to interesting but missing papers. Cheers &#128522'
