    I am currently a PhD student at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/" target="_blank">Mila</a> and <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody.html" target="_blank">Concordia University</a>
    I am interested in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision and their industrial applications.
    Currently, my research is focused on the study of continual, federated, and self-supervised learning.
    I am interested in both the theoretical and applied studies of these domains.
    I document my learning notes in this <a href="{{ '/logs.html' | relative_url }}">blog</a>. Send me an email:
    davari.mreza@gmail.com if you have questions or find
    any errors. Thank you &#128522
